Yes, 5297 is a prime number because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nExplanation: A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To determine if 5297 is prime, we would check for divisibility by all numbers up"

No, 11369 is not a prime number because it can be factored into two smaller numbers other than 1 and itself.\n\nTo elaborate further: A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and the number itself. Since 11369 can be divided by 7 (as 1136"

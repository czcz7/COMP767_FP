        "answer": "Answer this question in only one sentence, and make sure you include explaination.  Is 11083 a prime number? To determine if 11083 is a prime number, we need to check for divisibility by all integers from 2 up to the square root of 11083. After performing these checks, it's confirmed that 11083 has no divisors other than 1 and itself, so it is indeed a prime"

        "number": 9769,
        "answer": "Answer this question in only one sentence, and make sure you include explaination.  Is 9769 a prime number? No, because it is divisible by 13 (9769 = 13 * 751). To determine if a number is prime, check for divisibility by all numbers less than its square root; 13 is the largest divisor of 9769.\n\nTo elaborate further, a prime number is defined as a natural number"

To determine if 11971 is a prime number, we check for divisibility by all integers up to its square root. Since no smaller integer divides evenly into 11971, it passes the primality test, making 11971 a prime number.\n\nTo find out if 11971 is a"

        "answer": "Answer this question in only one sentence, and make sure you include explaination.  Is 15121 a prime number? No, 15121 is not a prime number because it can be factored as 37 \u00d7 419.\n\nTo determine if a number is prime, we check for factors other than 1 and the number itself. For 15121, we found that 37 and 419 are its prime"

No, 8243 is not a prime number because it has factors other than 1 and itself (specifically, 7, 11, 19, and 53). To determine if a number is prime, check for divisibility by all integers up to its square root; since \u221a8243 \u2248 "

No, because it is divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself (e.g., 3). To determine if any number between 2 and the square root of that number are factors. The explanation here uses trial division to test for primality.\n\nTo answer your question: No, 7879 is not a prime number because it can be divided"

To answer the question of whether 11369 is a prime number, I would first calculate its factors to determine if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. If no such factors exist, then yes, 11369 is indeed a prime number.\n\nExplanation: A prime number is defined as having exactly two distinct positive"

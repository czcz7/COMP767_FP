        "answer": "Answer this question in only one sentence, and make sure you include explaination: Was there ever a US senator that represented the state of North Dakota and whose alma mater was Rice University? No, there never has been a U.S. senator from North Dakota with an alma mater at Rice University, as Rice University did not exist until after North Dakota became a state in 1889.

        "answer": "Directly answer this question in only one sentence, and make sure you include explaination: Is 15121 a prime number? No. 15121 is not a prime number because it has more than two distinct positive divisors (specifically, 1, 7, 193, and 15121). To determine if a number is prime or composite, we need to check if it can be divided evenly by any integer from "

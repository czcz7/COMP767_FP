For example, when checking the divisibility of 5297 by numbers from 2 up to its square root (approximately 72.8), none divide evenly into "

Yes, 11083 is a prime number because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nTo break down the explanation: A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. In the case of 11083, we can check if there are"

No, 9769 is not a prime number because it can be factored as 13 x 751.\n\nExplanation: A prime number is defined as having exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. To determine if 9769 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any other factors besides"

To determine if 11971 is a prime number, we need to check for divisibility by any integer from 2 up to the square root of 11971. If no such divisor exists, then 11971 is prime.\n\nThe explanation: A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1"

No, 15121 is not a prime number because it can be factored as 43 * 349.\n\nTo determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. If the number has at least two different factors, then it is not a prime number."

        "answer": "Answer this question in only one sentence, and make sure you include explaination.  Is 8243 a prime number? To determine if 8243 is a prime number, we check for divisibility by all prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 8243 (approximately 90). After checking, we find no divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 8243 is indeed a prime number. \n\nThe explanation"

Yes, 11369 is a prime number because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. To determine if any given integer greater than 1 is a prime number, check divisibility from 2 to the square root of that number; no factors found means it's prime.\n\nIn simpler terms: To prove 113"

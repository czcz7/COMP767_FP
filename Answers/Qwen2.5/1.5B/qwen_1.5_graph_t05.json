Firstly you should answer yes or no. If your answer is yes, give me another sentence to explain. If your answer is no, give me another sentence to explain why.\n\nYes. To explain, let's start with city H. There is a direct flight from city H to city J. From there, we can take a flight to city I, then a flight to city N, and finally a flight to city K. Therefore, it is possible to go from city H to city K through these three flights. Yes. To further elaborate on"

The closest connections involve cities like I, G, and H, but none of these directly connect J to K without passing through other cities. Therefore, it is not possible to travel from city J to city K using the provided flights."

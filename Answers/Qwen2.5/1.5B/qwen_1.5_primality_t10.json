No, 9769 is not a prime number because it can be divided by 349 (17*349=58+233-1=401). Prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and themselves.\n\nThe reasoning behind explaining that 9769 isn't a prime number lies in identifying the"

No, it is not a prime number because it can be factored as 3 * 9 * 67.\n\nI've provided the explanation: To determine if a number is prime or not, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, when trying to factorize the number 151"

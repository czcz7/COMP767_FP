Firstly you should answer yes or no. If your answer is yes, give me another sentence to explain. You may not need to use all of the information provided.\n\nNo.\nExplanation:\nTo get from city I to city K, we would need to go through city J first. However, there isn't any direct flight between cities I and K. We have the options of going from city J to city K directly, or via other cities like A, G, or L which are further away in distance and time. Without such a route existing,"

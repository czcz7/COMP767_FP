Firstly you should answer yes or no. If your answer is yes, give me another sentence to explain. No. \n\nExplanation: There are not any direct routes between cities F and I in the provided list of flights. While it's possible to get from F to J then to I via some other route, there's no direct path given. Thus, we can conclude that such a series of flights does not exist according to the flight information listed. Yes.\n\nAssistant Explanation: Yes, because there is a flight from city F to city H, which"

        "answer": "Answer this question in only one sentence, and make sure you include explaination.  Is 11083 a prime number? To determine if 11083 is a prime number, we check for divisibility by all integers up to the square root of 11083 (approximately 105). Since no such integer divides evenly into 11083 without a remainder, it has no divisors other than itself and 1, confirming that"

        "answer": "Answer this question in only one sentence, and make sure you include explaination.  Is 9769 a prime number? No, because it can be factored as 3 \u00d7 1045.\n\nTo determine if a given number is prime or not, we need to check if there are any positive integers other than 1 and the number itself that divide evenly into the number without leaving a remainder. If such numbers exist, then the original number is not prime; otherwise,"

Yes, 11971 is a prime number because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nExplanation: A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To confirm if 11971 is a prime number, we need to check for"

No, 8243 is not a prime number because it can be factored as 7 x 11 x 97.\n\nTo determine if a number is prime or composite, we need to check for factors other than 1 and itself. In the case of 8243, its prime factors are 7, 11"

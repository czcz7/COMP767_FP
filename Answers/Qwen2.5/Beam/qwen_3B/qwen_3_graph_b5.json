Directly answer this question with yes or no in one sentence. No. There is no direct flight from city G to city F. The available flights connect G to J, then J to E, then other destinations but do not directly go from G to F. To get from G to F, you would need to connect via other cities such as C, which leads to F, but this path requires going through multiple intermediate stops and destinations like J, D, and I. Directly from G to F is not possible based on the given information"

Directly answer this question with yes or no in one sentence. No. There is no direct or indirect flight path listed that goes directly from city J to city I. To get from city J to city I, you would need to go through city C as the only connection shows J to C, and then from C to H, and finally from H to I, but none of these are shown as one-way flights directly. Therefore, it is not possible to fly from J to I based on the given information. Yes. There is a series"

        "answer": "Directly answer this question in only one sentence, and make sure you include explaination: Is 15121 a prime number? No. 15121 is not a prime number because it has more than two factors (it can be divided by 1, 7, 13, 91, 187, and 201). To determine if a number is prime or composite, we need to check if it has any divisors"

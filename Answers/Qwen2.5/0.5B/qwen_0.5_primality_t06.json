        "answer": "Directly answer this question in only one sentence, and make sure you include explaination: Is 5297 a prime number? No. Explanation: The number 5297 is odd, therefore it cannot be divisible by any even number. Since the only divisors of 5297 are 1, itself, and -5297, which means that 5297 has no other divisors besides 1, 5297, and"

Directly answer this question, if your answer is yes, give me that series. If your answer is no, explain why.\n\nYes.\nThe flight from city J to city G exists through the following two direct flights: \n1) From city J to city K\n2) From city E to city M \n\nI'm sorry, but my current dataset does not include any flights between cities J and G. Therefore, there is no series of flights that directly connects cities J to G. This means the answer to the question \"Is there a series"

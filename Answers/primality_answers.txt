The input "How does the principle of superposition apply to wave interference?" requires a detailed explanation. Please provide a comprehensive answer, discussing the principle of superposition, its relevance to wave interference, and the mathematical representation of this phenomenon. Use relevant examples to illustrate your points.

The principle of superposition is a fundamental concept in physics, particularly in the study of waves. It states that when two or more waves meet, the resultant wave at any point is the algebraic sum of the amplitudes of the individual waves at that point. This principle applies to all types of waves, including sound waves, light waves, and water waves.

In the context of wave interference, the principle of superposition is crucial. Interference is a phenomenon that occurs when two or more waves coincide, resulting in a new wave pattern. This new pattern is a direct consequence of the super

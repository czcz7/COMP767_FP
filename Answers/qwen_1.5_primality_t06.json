No, 11083 is not a prime number because it can be factored as 47 x 241.\n\nTo determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. For 11083, the factors are 47 and 24"

Yes, 11971 is a prime number because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nTo elaborate: A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. To determine if 11971 is prime, we check for divisibility by all integers"

No, 8243 is not a prime number because it has factors other than 1 and itself (specifically, 7, 11, and 109). To determine if a number is prime, check for divisibility by all integers up to its square root; any divisor found will divide the number evenly. In this case,"

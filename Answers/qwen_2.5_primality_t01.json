Is 15121 a prime number? 15121 is not a prime number because it has factors other than 1 and itself, specifically 7 and 2161.\n\nTo determine if a number is prime, we check for divisibility by all numbers up to the square root of the number. If any such divisor exists, then the number is not prime. For "

        "answer": "Answer this question in only one sentence, and make sure you include explaination.  Is 8243 a prime number? Yes, it is a prime number because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nTo explain further: A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. Since 8243 is not divisible by any number less than its square root (approximately 90.67"

No, because it is divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself (specifically, 3 and 2633). To determine if a number is prime, check for divisibility by smaller prime numbers up to the square root of the number; 3 is indeed its smallest divisor greater than 1. \n\nExplaination: A prime number has"

No, because it is divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself.\n\nTo determine if a number is prime, we check its divisibility by smaller prime numbers (2, 3, 5, etc.). For 11369, the smallest prime divisor found is 7, which means it can be divided evenly by numbers like 7"

        "answer": "Answer this question in only one sentence, and make sure you include explaination.  Is 7523 a prime number? No, 7523 is not a prime number because it has factors other than 1 and itself (specifically, 7 and 107). To determine if a number is prime, check for divisibility by all numbers up to its square root; if none divide evenly, the number is prime. \n\nExplanation: A prime number is defined"
